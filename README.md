# Hillel's Portfolio for "Telling Stories with Data"
Check this page regularly for updates on Hillel's progress in his course

#### About Me
  I (pronouns: he, him, his) am a second year student in The Robotics Institute's MRSD (Masters in Robotic Systems Development) Program. I have a Bachelors of Science degree from Rutgers University in Mechanical engineering, and I have worked both at L'Oreal USA and a local Pittsburgh startup, both in roles related to mechatronic devices. 

  My interests are primarily in mechanical design and manipulation, specifically related to how mechanisms and devices interact with their users. My hope is to use this passion to get a job as a mechatronic designer working on one of the many new smart proudcts that will be reaching consumers in the coming years.
  
#### What I Hope to Learn
  I am taking this course to improve my technological story telling skills. That is, how to convey complex information (such as a machine's state or usage statistics) in a way that is intuitive and meaningful to non-technical users. I also would like to learn to make my presentations and reports more compelling, both because it will help me profesisonally and will give me personal satisfaction.
