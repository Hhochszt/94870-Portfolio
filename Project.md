# Why Jews Live in New York: The Downfall of Rural Judaism

### Outline
The goal of this project is to look at the way American life has changed Judaism to exist primarily in the cities and suburbs.

1.	The problem Statement - Distribution of Jews by state
  1.	Map of synagogues – current climate as a visualization
  1.	Trend graph (slope or moving scatter) – change in Jewish Schools by state (growing in NY area, dropping almost everywhere else)
1.	Political Cause:
  1.	Political Leaning (pie) – from pew
  1.	Political Leaning relative to state leaning
1.	Practical Cause (still need data):
  1.	Resources (spiral away from rural areas, can use schools again?
  1.	Synagogue Distance (see if I can get a shul directory)
  1.	Some way to show general homogeneity in rural areas
1.	Some way to show diversity of Judaism is huge (religious practice and other ways)
1.	Anti-Semitism
  1.	Higher incidence of hate groups in rural areas???
