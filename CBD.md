# Critique by Design

### The old chart

This graphic appears all over the web as an example of a bad chart. I found it on [mammothgraphics.com](http://mammothinfographics.com/blog/the-top-10-worst-infographics-of-all-time) which contained minimal feedback as to how to make it better. The rest of this assignment was an endeavour into doing just that, first by using Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) and then be redesigning the chart and submitting that to uninvolved parties for their impressions and critiques.

### First Round of Redesigns

My first design idea was to recreate the same graphic (using the same conventions) albeit with truthful bars (i.e. the correct size) and a legend and careful use of the title, subtitle, and source fields, to remove the large amount of text in the original graphic.

As you can see in the image, I kept the grid of bar charts, but honestly reported each of them. I also changed the order of the controlled substances into what I perceived was the best order of magnitude (alcohol being the least addictive and dangerous, opiates being the most). Finally, I added a colored legend, and conveyed the relevant information in the subtitle and source fields, rather than including a large text box.

I also considered a second chart type, a "bullet chart" made in Tableau. This would use the same type of legend, and the exact same source and title information, but a different scheme for visualizing the data. My thought was that while the grid of charts was easy to read, more information could be gathered and trends could appear more easily if I grouped the data.

### The Feedback

I then showed this content to my wife. She immediately saw that perception was generally higher than actual usuage, and was her eye was particularly caught by the descrepancy for cocaine in the 1-9 times frequency position. She actually ignored alcohol entirely, and took almost half a minute to realize that alcohol at 1-9 times was the only condition where reality exceeded perception. She also disagreed with my ordering, saying that she would order them by their status as a crisis (meaning alcohol, opiates then cocaine). 
It is important to note that the way I pared down the block of text was sucessful, in that she immediately understood the data, and came up with similar audiences to what I had envisioned, such as college student pamphlet/seminars, campus safety leaders, and policy makers. 
As far as the actual way the data was conveyed, She agreed that the side by side of the bullet chart helped keep the data concise, and even give a more official look (she was not impressed by my drawing skills either) but thought that the setup of the bullet chart was too difficult to read, both in terms of labelling and basic clarity.

Using my wife's advice, I generated a new chart prototype and showed the series of charts to my sister. Her impressions on my first wireframe were similar to my wife's. She also noted that the legend was not easy to spot and it was difficult to remember that the frequency measres were out of the last 30 days. She was okay with the ordering of alcohol, cocaine, opiates, but she did not like how the first example in the grid was the one exception to the title's claim (she double checked the title and the legend twice to confirm it was an exception). She also said she was interested in seeing if I could consolidate the data to a single chart.
I then showed her the bar chart, where she also expressed that the consolidation was appreciated, but the actual chart left a lot to be desired. Specifically, the overlap effect seemed to take away from the impact of the discrepency between perceived and actual issues).

Then I showed her the prototype I had made with my wife's recomendations:

She like this one a lot better, and offered some direct critique. The first suggestion was to change the subtitle to say "usage and perceived usage." She also said that since she perceived the audience to include very nervous people, the scale should run to 100%, to demonstrate overall incidence as well as comparison. Finally she recommended some labelling and chart design tips (like thickening the lines between the different categories of substances, adding in the data labels, and moving around the axis labels to be more inviting).
