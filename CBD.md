# Critique by Design

### The old chart

This graphic appears all over the web as an example of a bad chart. I found it on [mammothgraphics.com](http://mammothinfographics.com/blog/the-top-10-worst-infographics-of-all-time) which contained minimal feedback as to how to make it better. The rest of this assignment was an endeavour into doing just that, first by using Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) and then be redesigning the chart and submitting that to uninvolved parties for their impressions and critiques.

### First Round of Redesigns

My first design idea was to recreate the same graphic (using the same conventions) albeit with truthful bars (i.e. the correct size) and a legend and careful use of the title, subtitle, and source fields, to remove the large amount of text in the original graphic.

As you can see in the image, I kept the grid of bar charts, but honestly reported each of them. I also changed the order of the controlled substances into what I perceived was the best order of magnitude (alcohol being the least addictive and dangerous, opiates being the most). Finally, I added a colored legend, and conveyed the relevant information in the subtitle and source fields, rather than including a large text box.

I also considered a second chart type, a "bullet chart" made in Tableau. This would use the same type of legend, and the exact same source and title information, but
